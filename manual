How to launch the LineageOS 14.1 build:

1) Add these repositories to your roomservice.xml:

  <project name="852Kerfunkle/android_device_zte_bladev7" path="device/zte/bladev7" remote="github" revision="master" />
  <project name="852Kerfunkle/android_vendor_zte_bladev7" path="vendor/zte/bladev7" remote="github" revision="master" />

2) sync.

3) Run these commands to patch lineage and to get the vendor blobs from your phone:

./device/zte/bladev7/patches/install.sh

(from devices/zte/bladev7)
To extract vendor blobs from device via adb:

./extract-files.sh

or, to extract vendor blobs from a mounted system image:

./extract-files.sh /path/to/system/image/mount

4) Build LineageOS

source build/envsetup.sh

lunch lineage_bladev7-userdebug

make bacon -j16

Wait for the build to finish.
